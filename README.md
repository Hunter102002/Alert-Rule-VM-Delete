# Create ALert Rule - VM Delete

## Objective

The Azure Alert Rule Creation project aimed to create an alert rule in Azure Monitor that would send an email notification to a user every time a virtual machine (VM) is deleted. The goal was to set up proactive monitoring for VM deletion events to ensure prompt response and recovery actions. This project focused on understanding Azure Monitor alert rules, configuring alert conditions, and setting up notification actions.

### Skills Learned

- Creation of alert rules in Azure Monitor for monitoring specific resource events.
- Configuration of alert conditions based on resource metrics, activity logs, or custom queries.
- Integration of email notifications as alert actions to notify users or teams.
- Understanding of Azure Monitor logs and metrics for monitoring and analyzing resource activity.
- Implementation of proactive monitoring strategies to detect and respond to critical events.

### Tools Used

- Azure Monitor for setting up alert rules and monitoring resource activity.
- Azure Portal or Azure CLI for configuring alert rules and managing resources.
- Email service for receiving alert notifications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Gmail).
- Azure Activity Log for reviewing resource activity and deletion events.
